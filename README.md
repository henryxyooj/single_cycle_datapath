Previous version of the project is called MIPS_old.java, this version doesn't have control signal implementations

Currently MIPS.java file is the one that's getting worked on.  There are other classes that helps the functionality of the program. 
Use the driver.java file to run the program, and to actually run it, give the main method a path to the MIPS .text and .data but in hexadecimal.

You can get the instructions from MIPS in hexadecimal by assembling the .asm file and then doing a memory dump with the option to output hexadecimal values.
